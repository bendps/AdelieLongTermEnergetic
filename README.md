# Energetics link long-term environmental variations to breeding success in a wild penguin population

This repository compile all the scripts used in the analyses of the paper "Energetics link long-term environmental variations to breeding success in a wild penguin population" published in Journal of Animal Ecology (2026).

All original data of logger used in this study are freely available at  https://doi.org/10.48579/PRO/ZX72PZ.

Scripts are numbered in the order they were and should be used.

At-sea environmental data were downloaded from the Copernicus Marine GLORYS12V1 dataset (https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021).
