# Energetics link long-term environmental variations to breeding success in a wild penguin population

This repository compile all the scripts used in the analyses of the paper "Energetics link long-term environmental variations to breeding success in a wild penguin population" published in Journal of Animal Ecology (2026).

All original data of logger used in this study are freely available at https://doi.org/10.48579/PRO/ZX72PZ (Kato & Ropert-Coudert, 2026). 

Scripts are numbered in the order they were and should be used.
Two extra script, not numbered, are also present in the repository. "R_function_toolbox" contains several custom function used for data curation. "get_meteo_france_data" can be used to dowload efficiently environmental data from the Météo France database (https://donneespubliques.meteofrance.fr/?fond=produit&id_produit=90&id_rubrique=32).

At-sea environmental data were downloaded from the Copernicus Marine GLORYS12V1 dataset (https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021).
